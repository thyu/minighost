# MiniGhost - A minimal Ghost theme

>Below are a few edits I made to the theme I thought people would want to use. 

MiniGhost is a minimal yet neat frame for [Ghost](http://ghost.org/). It is an open source, mobile first, CSS3-oriented, Javascript-free (except modernizr), customizable theme for personal blogging.
